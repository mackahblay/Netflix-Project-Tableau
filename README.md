# Netflix-Project-Tableau

Description:
Welcome to my Netflix project where I dive into the vast collection of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. Leveraging data from a CSV file containing information such as movie titles, directors, cast, countries, release years, and genres, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the content available on this popular streaming platform.

### Overview
This project begins with a CSV dataset filled with details about Netflix movies and TV shows. By utilizing Tableau Public, I created an interactive dashboard that sheds light on the top movie genres, ratings distribution, regional preferences, content distribution between movies and TV shows, and a historical view of releases over the years.

### Dashboards:
1. **Top 10 Movie Genres:**
   The first dashboard presents a bar chart showcasing the top 10 movie genres on Netflix. Genres such as Drama, Comedy, Action, etc., are displayed on the x-axis, with the number of movies falling under each genre on the y-axis. This visualization gives a quick overview of the most popular genres among Netflix's content.

2. **Ratings Distribution for Movie Types:**
   Moving on to the second dashboard, a bar chart illustrates the ratings distribution for different movie types (movies and TV shows). Here, the x-axis represents the ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, etc.), while the y-axis shows the count of movies falling into each rating category. This chart provides insights into how viewers rate movies versus TV shows on Netflix.

3. **Movies and TV Shows Watched by Country (Map Illustration):**
   The third dashboard presents an interactive map illustrating the distribution of movies and TV shows watched across different countries. Users can hover over each country to see the breakdown of the content types (movies and TV shows), providing insights into regional content preferences.

4. **Content Distribution: Movies vs. TV Shows:**
   The fourth visualization offers a pie chart depicting the distribution of content between movies and TV shows on Netflix. This chart provides a clear comparison of the percentage of movies versus TV shows in the overall Netflix library, helping users understand the platform's content focus.

5. **Movie and TV Show Releases Over the Years (Area Graph):**
   Finally, the last dashboard showcases an area graph displaying the trends of movie and TV show releases over the years. The x-axis represents the release years, while the y-axis shows the count of releases. This graph allows viewers to see the growth of content on Netflix over time, as well as trends in movie and TV show production.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this Netflix project offers an insightful exploration of movie and TV show trends available on the platform. From top movie genres to ratings distribution, regional preferences, content type distribution, and historical release trends, these visualizations provide valuable insights for both Netflix enthusiasts and analysts. Dive into the dashboards to uncover trends and patterns in Netflix's vast library of entertainment, and discover the evolving landscape of movies and TV shows on this popular streaming platform.
